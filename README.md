# Intelligent-Basket

We have designed a smart trolley in such a manner that every customer can manage the bill payment  using mobile application in any of the  android system, IOS etc. The regular customers are given an RFID tag which is used to connect to the trolley. They can then use the mobile application (k-mart) to manage the different products. The details of the customers are displayed on the LCD screen. Also the number of products in the basket and total price is displayed.
